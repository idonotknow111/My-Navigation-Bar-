    <h1>What is Ice Cream?</h1>
    <p>
        Ice cream is a sweet, frozen dessert made from dairy products such as milk and cream, combined with sugar and flavorings. It is churned while freezing to incorporate air and prevent the formation of large ice crystals, resulting in a smooth and creamy texture. Ice cream comes in a wide variety of flavors and can include ingredients like fruits, nuts, chocolate, and syrups. It is enjoyed around the world as a popular treat, especially during warm weather.
